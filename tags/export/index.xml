      <description>Better BibTex adds a couple of export formats to Zotero&amp;rsquo;s export dialog and several ways to improve export for plaintext-based authoring. The Better BibTeX configuration pane can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab &amp;lsquo;Better BibTeX&amp;rsquo; where you can tweak the exports, such as
 Omitting fields from exports to slim down your bib files. Configuring how citation keys are generated. And really a ton more.  Additionally you can automate exporting (parts of) your library either using auto-export or pull export.</description>

      <description>When exporting using one of the BBT translators (by right-clicking on a library, group or collection from the main window of Zotero) you will be offered a new export option: Keep updated. Checking this option registers the export for automation; any changes to the collection or library you exported after you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the current export will trigger an automatic re-export to update the bib file. You can review/remove exports from the BBT preferences.</description>

      <description>Are there any plans to support Firefox 57+? BBT lives where Zotero lives, and Zotero only has standalone these days. BBT is installed inside Zotero instead of in the browser. Please see the installation instructions to get started with BBT.
BBT is changing the capitalization of my titles &amp;ndash; why? There isn&amp;rsquo;t a straightforward one-to-one mapping for all Zotero to Bib(La)TeX fields. For most I can make reasonable choices, but there are some things where Better BibTeX takes a little more liberties with your references in order to get sensible output.</description>

      <description>You can fetch your bibliography on the url http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/collection?[collectionID].[format] 1. You can get this URL for a group, library or collection by right-clicking it and selecting Download Better BibTeX export...
You can add options to the export as URL parameters:
 &amp;amp;exportNotes=[true|false] &amp;amp;useJournalAbbreviation=[true|false]  You can fetch your library as part of your build, using something like curl from your Makefile, or with a BibLaTeX remote statement like
\addbibresource[location=remote]{http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/collection?/0/8CV58ZVD.biblatex} format can be:</description>

      <description>The Better BibTeX exporters are a lot slower than the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters. If you have a small library, you will not likely notice this, but if you have several thousand references, and you are in the habit of exporting substantial parts of your library, this gets annoying really fast.
To deal with this problem, Better BibTeX implements an extensive caching system. With a filled cache, Better BibTeX is substantially faster than the default Zotero exporters.</description>

      <description>The Better BibTeX Configuration can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab &amp;lsquo;Better BibTeX&amp;rsquo;.
The configuration of Better BibTeX is a little baroque compared to the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters (which only have hidden preferences). The defaults should just work, but here&amp;rsquo;s an attempt to describe what they do.
Making any change here will drop your entire export cache. This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved here.</description>

      <description>Better BibTeX bundles 5 translators you might care about:
Export These translators are supported by the auto-export functionality built into Better BibTeX:
 Better BibLaTeX exports references in BibLaTeX format (but better, natch) Better BibTeX exports references in BibTeX format Better CSL JSON exports references in pandoc-compatible CSL-JSON format, with added citation keys and parsing of metadata Better CSL YAML exports the same as the Better CSL JSON exporter, but in YAML format Collected Notes exports just notes &amp;ndash; standalone notes and notes attached to references, not the extra field &amp;ndash; to HTML.</description>
